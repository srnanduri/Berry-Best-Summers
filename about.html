        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Hi! My name is Strawberry! Me and my best friend, Blueberry made this interactive site when we were in Elementary School. We came up with the idea and name when we were in 4th grade. From then on, we started working. It was hard. Blueberry was in India, and I was in US. Considering the time zones, it was hard to meet at a particular time because if it's daytime for me and I'm free, it's midnight for Blueberry. But the only way we can constantly stay in touch, (there's actually another wayâ€¦) is this site. We brainstormed ideas that we can add on to this site, and show updates. I did the code, she did the ideas and came up with some names. Together, if we work together, we can be unstoppable. We rise by lifting others who fall. The reason why we made this site is because we want to show you just how fun and interactive your summer can be.</h3>
