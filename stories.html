            <h3>The left out dragonfruit</h3>
            <h4>The reason why I made this story is because we all feel like sour fruits at times, and the others keep reminding you how much of a sour fruit we are. But we can still move on!</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>One fine day, there was a dragonfruit cactus which took care of her dragonfruit carefully. But, there's always a time when the cactus is dying, so Dragonfruit had to leave the security of his home. One day, he came across a group of fruits, who seemed like cool dudes.</h4>
            <h4>"Dragonfruit, do you want to be friends?" A watermelon asked. "Sure, why not?" Replied the innocent Dragonfruit. If someone asks you if you want to be friends with him/her, nobody could say no, unless they know the full color.</h4>
            <h4>And so they became friends. Watermelon was very smart on social media, and Dragonfruit knew a lot about the real world. Together, they were an unstoppable team. But then, Dragonfruit got to know that Watermelon was part of the Coolguyz group! So he thought, "If my friend is part of their group, then I am, too!! YAY!!!" and skipped to Watermelon's vine. "Hey Watermelon, did you introduce me to your group??" He asked his nonchalant friend. "Yeah, they know you now!" Said Watermelon to the excited dragonfruit.</h4>
            <h4>But he was the only dragonfruit in the group! Dragonfruit felt left out. And the Coolguyz kept teasing him for it. Especially when they keep making snide comments. "Dragonfruit, why're you so sad? Is it because you're a BLUEBERRY now? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!" An apple said.  So Dragonfruit was furious. One day, he gave them an i-message(which is a way to express your feelings), which is apparently a way to stand up to people. "That's it!! I don't wanna be with your group!! They're mean, and they don't accept me for who I am. C'mon Watermelon!!" He exclaimed. Watermelon was surprised! "I thought you guys were my friends." She told them darkly. From then on, the two friends stopped playing with The Coolguyz, and went on with their life.</h4>
            <h3>The end!</h3>
